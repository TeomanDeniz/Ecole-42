vimpager for Debian
-------------------

I prefer that Debian packaging code is part of the upstream, which I
maintain at:

http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager

if you want to make changes to it, send me a pull request or send me an
email requesting to be added as a committer if you maintain a package
for a distribution.

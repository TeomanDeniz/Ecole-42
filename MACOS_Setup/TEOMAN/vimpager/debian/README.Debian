vimpager for Debian
-------------------

To use this pager, add the following to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc or
whatever shell configuration file you use:

PAGER=/usr/bin/vimpager
export PAGER

If you only want to use it as a pager for man pages, use the following
instead:

MANPAGER=/usr/bin/vimpager
export MANPAGER

See `man vimpager' for information on how to configure it.

2.07:
- stream large files and stdin instead of copying to /tmp
- allow clicking on man links in man and perldoc mode
- support 'K' for ft=vim (and Page! for vim commands, :help in this case)
- support non-unified color diffs

FUTURE:
- tabs do not look correct in vimcat on Solaris
- colors seem different on solaris and other OSes
- merge less.vim changes upstream
- save user's position in file on quit (using viminfo)
- patch man to preserve CWD

DONE:
- merge AnsiEsc changes upstream
- set cursor wrt scrolloff when toggling less mode
- remove ;file from ;messages
- add usage screen
- multiple file support
- better error message for unreadable files
- display actual file name on status line
- display statusline on startup
- key less dict values on bufnr, there are weird bugs with multiple buffers when toggling less mode
- for gvim only increase the number of columns if necessary for man pages
- make vimpager usable from vim with pathogen and other plugin handlers
- set buftype=nowrite only for processed files or stdin, and not in less.vim
- make vimcat streaming
- check if buffer was modified and is a normal buffer when moving to next arg on q
